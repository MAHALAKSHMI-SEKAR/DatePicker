# DatePicker

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using the [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) tool, designed to facilitate the development of a reusable Date Picker component.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

You can edit the page by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The page will automatically refresh to reflect your changes.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family, developed by Vercel.
